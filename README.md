### Hi, it's [Charlie](https://charlessliu.com/) :grinning:

I love designing all sorts of games and applications, but one thing must stay consistent - **designing with the user as the number one priority**. 

As an athlete myself, I know personally a struggle that almost all athletes have - being able to train effectively when they train alone. That's why I created [Techniq](https://github.com/CharlieLiu17/Techniq).

As a longtime League player, I created [a program](https://github.com/CharlieLiu17/league-projects) to prepare players with important information before a game, to maximize players' potentials at every step.

When I discovered the important role that tax sales and foreclosures play in the housing industry, I created the ultimate [parser](https://github.com/CharlieLiu17/tax-sale-foreclosure-parser) that allowed for easy viewing and organization for potential buyers.
